# Crippen-Mol
Example how to calculate CrippenMR using RDKit, Calculate molecular formulas and Calcuate the # of atoms per smile including Hydrogens.

Just load https://mybinder.org and paste the URL https://github.com/EddieNewcastle/Crippen-Mol into the top and hit LAUNCH

Then go to Examples:

If you want to upload your own Smiles file and run the code just hit UPLOAD and download the file in (make sure it has .smi and is one smile per line no spaces)

Then open the CrippenCalculation.ipynb

Click RUN to run through the code or if you have uploaded your own file replace the ExampleSmiles.smi with YOURFILENAME.smi

Then click RUN to generate the values.

EXTRA: If you want to calculate Chem.Crippen.MolLogP I have pasted at the top of CrippenCalculation.ipynb on how to do this.
Just replace the Chem.Crippen.MolMR for Chem.Crippen.MolLogP
